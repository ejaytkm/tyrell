## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

The code above will initialize the docker. Please wait completely for application to start.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

cd projects/cardgame

### Building

### Deploying / Publishing
## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* Generate cards for input amount of players. Give them empty if players exceed 52.
* Optimize SQL Queries fully.

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.
